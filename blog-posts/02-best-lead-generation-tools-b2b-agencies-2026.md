## FAQ: Lead Generation Tools

**Q: Can I use multiple tools together?**

A: Absolutely! Many agencies use a combination. For example: LeadRipper for initial prospecting → Hunter.io for email finding → Apollo.io for sequencing.

**Q: What's more important: database size or data quality?**

A: Data quality wins every time. A list of 1,000 accurate, validated contacts is worth more than 100,000 outdated, incorrect ones.

**Q: Do I need technical skills to use these tools?**

A: Most tools (LeadRipper, Hunter, Lusha, Apollo) are no-code. Enterprise tools (ZoomInfo, Cognism) may require training or dedicated team members.

**Q: How do I know if a tool is worth the investment?**

A: Calculate your target cost per acquisition. If you close 1% of leads at $500 average deal value, 1,000 leads = $5,000 revenue. If the tool costs $149, your ROI is 33x.

**Q: Are there free lead generation tools?**

A: Yes! Free tiers exist for: Apollo.io (12K credits/year), Hunter.io (25/month), Lusha (5/month), LinkedIn (basic search), Leadfeeder (lite version).

**Q: How often should I refresh my lead database?**

A: For active campaigns, refresh monthly. Contact information changes frequently (20-30% annual decay rate).
